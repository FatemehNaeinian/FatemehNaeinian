### :woman: About Me:

Hi! Iâ€™m Fatemeh Naeinian, a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at New York University (NYU). My research focuses on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, with interests in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran. During my undergrad, I worked on a deep learning-based approach for robotic grasp planning, which led to a publication at the 32nd International Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE 2024).

Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent systems that can operate reliably in the real world, and I am excited to keep learning and contributing in this space.
